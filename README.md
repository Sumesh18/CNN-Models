# CNN Models

This repository contains a collection of image classification models implemented using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Each project explores different architectures, datasets, and training techniques commonly used in computer vision tasks.

## Included Models

1. **Fashion MNIST Classifier**  
   A simple CNN-based image classifier trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset.

2. **Horses vs Humans Classifier**  
   A binary image classifier built using a small, custom dataset.

3. **Cats vs Dogs Classifier**  
   A binary classifier trained on the Cats and Dogs dataset sourced from Kaggle.

4. **Rock–Paper–Scissors Classifier**  
   An image classification model built using Keras `ImageDataGenerator` for data augmentation and preprocessing.

5. **Cats vs Dogs with Transfer Learning**  
   A CNN model leveraging transfer learning to improve performance and training efficiency.

6. **Dropout Regularization Experiment**  
   Implementation of dropout regularization techniques to reduce overfitting and improve model generalization.


## Dataset
